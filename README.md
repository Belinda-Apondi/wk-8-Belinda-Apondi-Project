This project implements a comprehensive database management system for a thrift store using MySQL. It tracks inventory, customers, employees, donors, locations, sales, promotions, and volunteer hours. The goal is to simulate a real-world retail system that ensures data integrity, proper relationships, and normalized structures for efficient management and reporting.
